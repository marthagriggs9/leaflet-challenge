## Background

The United States Geographical Survey, or USGS, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazrds, the health of our ecosystems and environment and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant and useful information about the Earth and its processes. 

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

## Part 1: Create the EArthquake Visualization

Your first task is to visualize an earthquake data set. Complete the following steps:

1. Get your dataset. To do so, follow these steps:
   * The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visit the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page and choose a data set to visualize.
